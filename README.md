Library Management System

Overview:
The Library Management System is a robust solution for managing library resources, developed using Java, Python, and an SQL backend. 

The system includes:
Book tracking, lender management, and inventory control.
Optimized sorting and searching algorithms to handle large datasets efficiently.
A combination of Java and Python components for database operations, data processing, and algorithm implementation.

Features:
Automated Book Tracking: Tracks each book's availability in real time.
Lender Management: Manages book lending, returns, and maintains inventory status.
Efficient Algorithms: Utilizes custom sorting (quicksort) and search algorithms for fast data retrieval.
Testing: Comprehensive unit, integration, and user acceptance testing to ensure system reliability.

Usage:
Adding Books: Add a book to the database with addBook (Java).
Lending/Returning Books: Use lendBook and returnBook (Java) to manage loans.
Search Books: Search using searchBooks (Java) or search_books(keyword) (Python).
Sorting: Use the quicksort function in DataProcessing.py for custom data sorting.
